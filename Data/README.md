==================
Updated August 7, 2024

## Data Folder

This folder contains the following directories/files:

- netsurf
	- This contains the results of the respective protein sequences being analyzed using NetSurf2.0

- MBsubtracted_LCMS_Data.xlsx
	- This contains the LCMS data after magnetic bead subtraction. This file contains the data from which the protein corona composition was determined.

- origamiDatabase.xlsx
	- This contains files estimating various geometric and other properties about each nanostructure.

- string_interactions_short.tsv
	- This file is generated by the STRING database and contains the interactions found between the proteins that are present in the nanostructures. (CHECK)

- string_mapping.tsv
	- This file is also generated by the STRING database and contains a dictionary for mapping the STRING annotations to the IDs used in the rest of the analyses.
